# Modeling High-Strike Red Sox Pitchers vs Yankees

The Red Sox-Yankees rivalry is known to be the oldest and most famous Major League Baseball (MLB) rivalry dating back to the early 1900s. How well do the Red Sox perform against their biggest rival? The all-time record of these two teams playing each other has the Yankees winning about 200 more games than the Red Sox in the regular season. In this project, I seek to analyze the performance of the Red Sox pitchers against the Yankees by modeling the probability of a pitcher throwing a high proportion of strikes against a particular batter. Using this model, it may be possible to determine what pitchers should pitch against the Yankees as well as what types of pitches should be thrown to certain batters.

It is widely known that statistics plays a huge role in optimizing MLB team performance. Many researchers use machine learning techniques and random forests to answer baseball questions. In one article, the author compared many models like random forest, neural network, and support vector machine to predict player strikeout rates which produced predictions with low error rates. In this analysis, I see how different logistic regression models compare.
